# LeetCode-java

This is a collaborative platform for analyzing and solving LeetCode questions using JAVA:
1. All the answers and code are written by myself.
2. what you can do is to add some more comments on how to make my code have a better running and/or memort usage.
3. feel free to change my code since some of the lines are unnecessary and seems stupid.
4. In the future, I might provide other programming laguage versions such as C, C++, Python, Golang, etc.
